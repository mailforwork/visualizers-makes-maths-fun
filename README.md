## About
Attention all you math enthusiasts and nerds out there! We've got a sweet new project that's going to make calculus, graphs, and algorithms easier than ever before. Our visualizer is like a magic wand that brings math to life with epic graphics and real-time function updates. 


### Ideation

### Features
-   Interactive animations tools
-   Real-time graphical visualization of mathematical concepts
-   User-friendly interface to make changes in functions
-   Support for high school and college level concepts
-   Separate modules for algorithms, calculus and graphs
-   Integration of all modules into a single web application

## Process
 - **Designed the Landing Page for Algo visualizer**

## Future Scope
Check out what's in store for the future of our math-tastic project!

1. I am planning on adding support for some seriously advanced mathematical concepts and more complex algorithms.
2. I am also working on visualizer for taylor series, riemann series and basic graphs on a grid.
3. I am also planning on adding some slick new features, like the ability to save and share your visualizations with the world. Imagine being able to show off your skills to your friends, family, and even your recruiter.
4. I will also try making a progressive web application for this so its accessible on mobile as well.
